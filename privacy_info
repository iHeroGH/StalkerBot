While the name of the bot may be slightly misleading, StalkerBot is dedicated to keeping users' privacy safe:
        StalkerBot never saves your messages outside of Discord.
        StalkerBot only sends messages to other users if a keyword is said in those messages (or if the message is a reply).
        StalkerBot can access messages sent to it in DMs. (Message Hero#2313 to be removed from the DM list - this will not affect your keywords)
        This is to be able to provide bot support at ease to the user.

        Note: Opting out and then opting back in will remove you from the DM list and place you back into the rest of the features.

        To opt-out of triggering keywords, recieving keywords, and triggering the StalkerBot DM check, run the /optout command.
        To opt back in, run the /optin command
        All users are opted in by default.
